# Memo

Memo is an Anki mobile app written in Flutter. This repository holds the source code for the hybrid application - currently iOS & Android versions - of Memo.

> As of now, this project is designed to only output builds for Android and iOS. Even though, given the current steps of the Flutter SDK & Dart language, there is a high possibility of compiling builds for Native desktop (Linux, Mac & Windows) & Web, but they are currently not targeted by the project.

This README is meant to guide how this project is structured and should serve as a guide to help the project scale with the current and future requirements. Think of it like a flexible set of rules that guides the project's decisions. While they can (and probably will) change over the time, discussions must be raised to trigger such changes: this means that we will think/question ourselves before taking an action that breaks any rational decision taken here. It is also effective to guide PR discussions.
