# Memo

Memo is a programming-oriented [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) software (SRS) written in Flutter.

> As of now, this project is designed to only output builds for Android and iOS. Even though, given the current *stability* of
> Flutter SDK for desktop (Windows, Linux and macOS) and web, there is a high probability that this project will also support
> builds for all plaftorms.

This README is meant to guide how this project is structured and should serve as a guide to help the project scale with 
the current and future requirements. Think of it as a flexible set of rules that guides the project's decisions. While 
they can (and probably will) change over time, discussions must be raised to trigger such changes: this means that 
we will think/question ourselves before taking an action that breaks any rational decision taken here. It is also 
effective to guide PR discussions.
